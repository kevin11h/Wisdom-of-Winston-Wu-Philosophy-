The Message of the Cross

> …20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age?

> …21 Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know Him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.
